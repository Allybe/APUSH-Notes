## Seven Years War / French and Indian War, 1753 - 1763 

### The Seven years war
  
  During the late 17th & 18th, 4 global conflicts has happened between competing European colonial power Britain, France, and Spain.

  - The winner would win over the West Indies and Canada. And would also gain control over the lucrative colonial trade.

  - The first three wars between England and France were *mostly* in Europe.
    - And only secondarily on conflict in the colonies → European powers saw little value in sending troops to America.
 
 In the final war (THE FRENCH & INDIAN WAR / Seven years old war (real creative, huh?)) the fighting began in the colonies and then spread to Europe.

 - England and France now recognized the full importance of their colonies and shipped large numbers of troops overseas to North America rather than rely on “amateur” colonial forces.

### The French And Indian War 
 - Not actually between the French and Indians, but they did try to get allegiances with Native Americans.

 - Took more lives than the American Revolution and took place on three continents including the Caribbean 

 - The British won, but it left them deep in debt.. .

 - **REMINDER: Winner takes a lot of North American Territory.**

### Fort Necessity

  - In 1754, fighting broke out at Fort Necessity. Under George Washington's command, 1/3 of colonist soldiers were killed.
    - "I led my men straight into a massacre, I witnessed their deaths firsthand, I made every mistake and felt the shame rise in me" - History Has Its Eyes On You, George Washington.

  - The start of the French & Indian War, the native Americans side with the French.

#### The War in Three Phases

 1. Phase 1 (1754 - 1755)
    * Primarily a local, North American conflict during this phase, at the urging of Benjamin Franklin, delegates met in Albany to devise a plan, called the **Albany Plan of Union**.

    * They rejected the plan, however, because they were wary of a consolidation of power
 
 2. Phase 2 (1756 - 1757)
    * Fighting in Europe and beyond, with the bulk still in North America English Secretary of State, William Pitt, took control of the war, planning military strategy and issuing orders to colonists

    * English suffered defeat after defeat

 3. Phase 3 (1758 - 1763)
    * Pitt dispatched large numbers of British troops to America, turning the tide of the war in England’s favor

    * September 1760: French formally surrender

##### Effects

  - **THE FRENCH LOST, TREATY OF PARIS (1763)**
    - To England, the French ceded territory east of Mississippi 

    - To Spain, they ceded territory west of the Mississippi

    - **The British are *broke*.**
      - England’s territorial claims expanded
      - The British emerged as the dominant North American colonial power

  - **Pontiac's Rebellion**
    - With new lands, colonists began to move west over the Appalachian Mountains and into western tribal lands
    
    - An alliance of tribes under Chief Pontiac, struck back. 
      - Fighting lasted 18 month

    - To protect the colonists, King George III issued the Proclamation of 1763, barring Americans from settling west of the Appalachians.
      - The colonist, simply ignored the order. LOL.

  -  **Relationship between Britain and the Colonists**
    - The British came away from the war with a low opinion of the colonial military effort. 
    - The colonists took an opposite view of their military performance.

  - **War debt and taxation**
    - Previously, Britain exercised little direct control over the colonies and had allowed its Navigation Laws to go unenforced. 
    - The wars had been extremely costly.
    - Britain’s debt doubled in the wake of the war.
    - England, as a result, ended the long period of salutary neglect and attempted to increase authority over the colonists
    
    - They passed several acts in the colonies to raise revenue:
      - 1764 Currency Act
        - Forbade the colonies from issuing paper money
      - 1764 Sugar Act
        - Not much colonial resistance
        - Impacted merchants (tax was on import of sugar)
        - Tax was cut in half, but actually collected
      - 1765 Quartering Act
        - Requiring colonial authorities to provide food, drink, quarters, fuel, and transportation to British forces stationed in their towns or villages.
      - 1765 The Stamp Act
        - Impacted every colonist that purchased paper goods.
        - Affected all legal documents
