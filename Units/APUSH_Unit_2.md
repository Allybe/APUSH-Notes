## Wars timeline

 Keep in mind that most of the time there is a war happening in both places, at the same times. Especially, the Seven Years' War & French and Indian War because I know you will get confused between the two.

### European wars

 Sep 27, 1688 – Sep 20, 1697

#### War of the Spanish Succession

#### War of the Austrian Succession

## Seven Years War / French and Indian War, 1753 - 1763 

### The French And Indian War 
 - Not actually between the French and Indians, but they did try to get allegiances with Native Americans.

 - Took more lives than the American Revolution and took place on three continents including the Caribbean 

 - The British won, but it left them deep in debt.. .

 - **REMINDER: Winner takes a lot of North American Territory.**

### The Seven years war
  
  During the late 17th & 18th, 4 global conflicts has happened between competing European colonial power Britain, France, and Spain.

  - The winner would win over the West Indies and Canada. And would also gain control over the lucrative colonial trade.

  - The first three wars between England and France were *mostly* in Europe.
    - And only secondarily on conflict in the colonies → European powers saw little value in sending troops to America.
 
 In the final war (THE FRENCH & INDIAN WAR / Seven years old war (real creative, huh?)) the fighting began in the colonies and then spread to Europe.

 - England and France now recognized the full importance of their colonies and shipped large numbers of troops overseas to North America rather than rely on “amateur” colonial forces.


### Fort Necessity

  - In 1754, fighting broke out at Fort Necessity. Under George Washington's command, 1/3 of colonist soldiers were killed.
    - "I led my men straight into a massacre, I witnessed their deaths firsthand, I made every mistake and felt the shame rise in me" - History Has Its Eyes On You, Hamilton.

  - The start of the French & Indian War, the native Americans side with the French.

#### The War in Three Phases

 1. Phase 1 (1754 - 1755)
    * Primarily a local, North American conflict during this phase, at the urging of Benjamin Franklin, delegates met in Albany to devise a plan, called the **Albany Plan of Union**.

    * They rejected the plan, however, because they were wary of a consolidation of power
 
 2. Phase 2 (1756 - 1757)
    * Fighting in Europe and beyond, with the bulk still in North America English Secretary of State, William Pitt, took control of the war, planning military strategy and issuing orders to colonists

    * English suffered defeat after defeat

 3. Phase 3 (1758 - 1763)
    * Pitt dispatched large numbers of British troops to America, turning the tide of the war in England’s favor

    * September 1760: French formally surrender

##### Effects

  - **THE FRENCH LOST, TREATY OF PARIS (1763)**
    - To England, the French ceded territory east of Mississippi 

    - To Spain, they ceded territory west of the Mississippi

    - The British are *broke*.
      - England’s territorial claims expanded
      - The British emerged as the dominant North American colonial power

# The French

France’s territory was vast, controlling the entire interior of the continent. To secure their hold, they founded a string of fortresses and trading posts. 
Cause it doesn't help to *say* that you own some place unless your people are there.
