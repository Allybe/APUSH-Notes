# Unit 2

## The Seven years war

 During the late 17th & 18th, 4 global conflicts has happened between competing European colonial power Britain, France, and Spain.

 - The winner would win over the West Indies and Canada. And would also gain control over the lucrative colonial trade.

 - The first three wars between England and France were *mostly* in Europe.
 	- And only secondarily on conflict in the colonies → European powers saw little value in sending troops to America. 

 In the final war (THE FRENCH & INDIAN WAR / Seven years old war (real creative, huh?)) the fighting began in the colonies and then spread to Europe. 
	
 - England and France now recognized the full importance of their colonies and shipped large numbers of troops overseas to North America rather than rely on “amateur” colonial forces.

 - The Start
	
 - Relates to the Seven Years' War, just in America isntead.

 - Not actually between the French and Indians.

 - Took more lives than the American Revolution and took place on three continents including the Caribbean.

 - The British won, but it left them deep in debt... which would cause the taxation of colonies.

## The French

France’s territory was vast, controlling the entire interior of the continent. To secure their hold, they founded a string of fortresses and trading posts. 
Cause it doesn't help to *say* that you own some place unless your people are there.
